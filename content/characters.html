          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">Rumored to have once been a beautiful princess,
            legend says Cassiopeia vanished into the mountains when her sister 
            staged a coup, never to return. So great was her beauty, and so renowned 
            her cunning, that a shrine was built to honor this 'spirit of temptation', 
            until her story was accepted into popular folklore.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">Darius' body fell to the dirt, yet another soldier's 
            sacrifice. But his soul would not rest. Picking up his axe just as soon as 
            it was knocked from his mortal hand, the Spirit of War arose. A calamity 
            motivated only towards bloodshed, Darius stalks the mortal world, searching 
            for the thrill of battle.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">A shy fawn spirit, Lillia once served as the guardian 
            of a sacred Ionian forest—until her grove was destroyed and cast into flame. 
            Consumed by loss, she now slumbers in the spirit realm, reliving the destruction 
            in an unending nightmare—unaware of the timid hope still waiting to bloom...</div>

          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">Legends speak of Master Yi, a swordsman who took 
            but one student in his lifetime. After an unceremonious betrayal, Yi 
            perished—not from a blade, but from a broken heart. Now the Spirit of 
            Legacy roams the spirit world, searching for a pupil. He is lost, anyone 
            that joins him destined to face the same fate.</div>

          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">A brave warrior from an ancient land, Riven was 
            ignobly cut down in the heat of battle thousands of years ago, her 
            sword shattering in the process. Unable to find peace, she obsessively 
            scours an otherworldly battlefield for pieces of her broken blade, 
            possessed by a horrific darkness that guides her into oblivion.</div>

          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">In a secluded corner of the Akana forest, Soraka 
            weeps for those she's lost. Each life cut short she longed to save, 
            but for as many that welcome her as a savior, there are others who 
            see her power as a merciless cruelty. To the Spirit of Pity, death 
            is never a blessing.</div>

          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">An ancient demon of obsession, Thresh delights in 
            tormenting the spirits of those he deems as flawed, but blossoming with 
            potential. He haunts the spiritual afterlife as a supreme collector of souls, 
            tempting the dead away from their path to salvation until they are trapped 
            for eternity within their own memories.</div>

          <div class="chara-border">❀</div>
          <div class="chara-bio">For those that seek glory on the battlefield, to 
            those that look to the spirits for a bountiful harvest, Tristana 
            greets all with a toothy grin. The Spirit of Chance has no favorites, 
            no obligations or motives. She simply delights in the chaos, the fear 
            in men's eyes at the roll of the dice.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">Vayne came from a lost clan of monster hunters, 
            annihilated to the last when the primordial demon of pain chanced 
            upon their hidden village. Unable to let go, and doomed to her own 
            obsessions for eternity, she hunts the creature without end, always 
            unable to catch it.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">The grove he called home burnt to ashes before 
            his very eyes. While another retreated into solitude, Yorick allowed 
            the rage to consume him. The flowers and trees that bloom in the Spirit 
            of Ruin's wake are haunting, the gardeners that tend to them howling 
            creatures of the night.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">The famed Spirit of Salvation, and the fox all 
            mortals are beckoned towards when their souls arrive to the spirit 
            realm. A capricious, whimsical spirit who sees the fate of the living 
            as a game of chase, she offers the chance for souls to find their 
            final rest… but will not intervene if they stray from the path.</div>

            Spirit World. Bring with you only your desires, your vices, your painful 
            memories. Let the Spirit of Love feed on these unwanted temptations, 
            for her hunger is ravenous. Evelynn will show you peace at last.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">Children hear stories of the savior of lost souls, 
            the ever-reclusive Spirit of Freedom. One such speaks of a tree that 
            wrapped its roots around a wandering wisp. The wisp struggled alone—
            until Syndra ripped off the bindings that held it tight, as she would 
            do for all creatures, lest they be lost forever.</div>

          <div class="chara-bio">Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across 
            Ionia. Yasuo, the younger brother, was a warlord renowned for his 
            roguish demeanor—until he was accused of crimes against the country 
            and took up arms to defend himself. Both were fated to fall in their

            adherence to honor and duty. He fought to defend the country 
            against those who would break its rites and rituals - until he was

            <div class="chara-bio">Ionians share whispered stories of the twin spirits
              of the night, Aphelios and Alune. It is said the darkening of the sky 
              comes from the brother's armaments, tearing the fabric of blues and whites 
              apart to create an obsidian canvas painted with stars. The sister's motives

            <div class="chara-bio">In the Ionian tradition, the Kindred are interpreted 
              as a child and her beastly companion, endlessly playing games with 
              one another until they are called to perform their duties. The two 
              do not know where they came from, but it is said they feel a sense 
              of loss for someone they knew long ago…</div>

              harmoniously until, abandoned by his father, he sought retribution.
